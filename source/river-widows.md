<small>Look, I’m not one</small> to judge but I gotta tell it like it is. How I saw it, con mis dos ojos bien pelados like shiny planets frowning down on Earth. What I saw wasn't the Thing That Happened. Only 1% of murders ever get solved here so, when I caught wind of the story, I was quick enough to go nosing at the potential consequences and not the build up, and started probing the past and future with fresh ideas instead of poking a dead body with hollow questions. A life had ended, yes, but the murder was nothing but the beginning de un gran relajo. 

About Miguel Ángel there is much to say. That malacate sin suerte. After all, this is a brief report on the last chapter of his damned life. And about me, there’s but one thing to know: I never met him. I saw him once or twice, tho. Alive. And then many more, cold like a dead turkey. A rather familiar cara de mamey across the street but never an acquaintance. I was on my way to becoming a journalist, he was interested in avoiding notoriety. Except that he died mysteriously one day. Sin querer,  se volvió famoso de la nada. Pum! Lo dejaron pelado y bien muerto. The next time I saw him, cáscara de plátano smeared on the sidewalk, he was lifeless but wearing an impeccably preserved expression of pain, fear and repulsion. Whatever terrible thing had happened to him had just happened. You could feel his body still shivering due to whatever bizarro torture had been applied to it.

## River Widows

<small>Locals call them river widows</small>. They’re out there washing and weeping along the riverbanks for the better part of the morning. Washing their black clothes and washing away their sins and sorrows, they say. They’re known for keeping --weeping-- the dry season at bay. "Las doñas lloran ríos” is both the puebloites' favorite colloquial expression and fundamental belief, as if the river widows were some sort of mystical clairvoyants channeling the will of the unborn into physical reality. Perhaps they were doing just that. Or even more... Morose and carrying the cross of suffering like pious sisters, their souls darkened by sorrow, the river widows were all but joyful. Their rictus is at all times severe. Every one of them has lost someone or something. Uno o dos maridos, un familiar, casi siempre un hijo, una casa, una vida. They are respected and feared. And not one single person in this damn shanty town knows what they do or where they are from sundown til sunrise. No one would ever suspect anything of them when it gets dark. I, of course, had a nose for darkness...

Doña Rosalía Ixuy viuda de Quiñonez was a river widow. Was because she is no longer with us, but back then she had everything that would turn you into a chickenshit-scared schoolboy and permanently afraid of any sort of widow. Heck, she was the leader of a mystery-ridden gang wearing all-black gowns. These doñas would put any teenage gang of goth punks to shame with their outfits. But it wasn't just the dressage, the resolute conquest of black clothing over their aching bodies. It was the intense, mortifying spirit hovering around them like a Dementor, a living reminder about death’s inescapable  proximity and about everything that is wrong con el mundo de los hombres. Two river widows --for no river widow was ever seen without a companion-- could walk into the loudest bar at the drunkest hour of a Friday night and, without uttering a word, would shut down the circus. Todos los borrachos, calabaza. There was something about the way the locals talked about the river widows that made me think of them as a religious gang of nasty, blood-thirsty hoodlums. And this was not to be understood or explained. At least not until Miguel Ángel's death. 

Rosalía was also Migue Angél's mother. The poor bastard had the worst luck ever. Not even the family card was dealt with some luck, nothing to give him a leg up in his game of fuck-up life. 


## The Local Economy

<small>Around here, the paychecks</small> are scattered. Los maridos son jornaleros. They live from day to day. Not in the zen way of privileged yogis or isolated monks, but in the I don’t-know-where-in-the-heavens-I’ll-find-work-tomorrow kind of way. En la Costa Sur and in the Highlands, los finqueros have managed to grow almost every damn crop at least twice per year, and outside of their normal harvesting season. In a country run like a conglomerate of massive haciendas, the rich patrones like to play god and defy the natural course of things. They do so by using fertilizers prohibited everywhere else in this planet and terrifying maltrato laboral. They pump out piñas, caña de azúcar, rosas, cacao, cardamomo and coffee beans like a thousand Chinese factories vomiting computer chips. In the city, the best these jornaleros --and sometimes joined by their daughters, sisters, mothers or wives-- can hope for is becoming an albañil or finding work "around the big houses" as gardeners, choferes or handymen for some rich, clueless fucker. One day there’s work. Next day you die. It’s the wild wild west on less than $2 a day.

Cada quincena y en los días de aguinaldo, especially, crime goes up. That’s how the press invokes a sickening tactic of depersonalization, so readers can stomach reality and go about their lives. More accurately, on the 15th or last day of every month, some pobre malnacido gets his money stolen and a bullet through his pie hole for lunch. Not a single motherfucker gives a rats arse about those vague concepts like derechos humanos and win-win situations. Aquí, you’re ahead or behind. You fuck or you get fucked, papito. 

Y aquí todavía se acuerdan muy bien de la guerrilla. First were the conquistadores con sus latifundios y pueblos de indios. And when stomping the locals started to slide into the unavoidable law of diminishing marginal returns to sadist satisfaction, la Guerra Civil broke out. Fucked by the newcomers, fucked by the government, triple-fucked by the army. It was a fuck fest all around and they were the ones left at the bottom of the fucking pit, the shit-heavy floors of the pecking order. 

Some pueblos were reduced to ashes and bone-dust during those THIRTY SIX YEARS OF HOT CIVIL WAR. The thing to be discussed at the courts today is to settle whether these raids and massacres where genocidios or not. The fact that innocent people were killed is besides the point, mula. El resarcimiento siempre puede esperar...

And the police? Bien gracias. Outlaws, man. Literally. 
Out here, everyone is ruled by nothing but their fuckedupness. Or moral compass. Como sea, anarchy and freedom would be too philosophical. 

## Lo que sabemos

<small>Miguel Ángel, age 22</small>, had no beef with anyone. 
Rosalía loved Miguel Ángel. Miguel Ángel loved his mother. 
99% of murders go unsolved in this country. 
The War on Drugs...
Dope is grown and/or produced in Central and South America; it then travels by sea, river or land through the veins of Central America and through the US-Mexico border, towards  "La Garganta Insaciable". 
Taxiing at your local dealer, it finds its way to its final destination: your pocket, the heart-pump of this economy. 

The fucken facts. 

## Y lo que no podríamos haber imaginado

<small>"Las doñas que lloran ríos</small>" were part of the most profitable drug cartel in all of the Triángulo Norte de Centro América. They were all leading fake lives to keep the business going and the dope flowing. Fake-mourning the family members they had killed THEMSELVES in most cases. Of special interest to these businesswomen were their male sons. Las niñas would get you in too much trouble due to all the international propaganda and political support against la violencia contra la mujer. Las doñas fucked so they could get working capital, talento humano. And you thought people in conditions of poverty multiply like record-breaking, fast-fucking rabbits for no reason? Many would say it’s reasonable to think: “these people are dumb; that’s why they're poor”. But people in conditions of poverty are people, as smart and as dumb as your average Joe in your average affluent city, if only more vulnerable. Anyway, enough with the holier-than-thou shit. Back to our story. 

## Modus operandi

<small>The river widows received a</small> certain number of dead bodies that came floating downstream into their section of the river. This section was a predefined area known as a distrito, the territory where they worked and where they had the monopoly on the magic powder. No other group of mareros or traficantes could mess with them without wrecking havoc within the entire system. 

The floating cadavers where vessels of “la buena nueva”. There were three sets of encrypted equations --marero accounting 101 and advanced cryptography-- written on each lifeless body. From top to bottom: at the forehead, the exact date when the body had become a cadaver; next, towards the belly, the quantities (in kilos) of how much dope was planted in the cadaver and how much was to stay at their own distrito to be sold or inspected; and, at last, around the shins or ankles, how much should reach the final destination, sometimes with an additional note of the suggested retail price per kilo. Perhaps someone up high went to Harvard Business School after getting his undergrad on the streets. 

You just gotta believe the rivers were never dry in Latinoamérica y el Caribe, man. To keep the business growing and the dope flowing. 

Realismo mágico my white ass. 

## Dry mule

<small>What was special about Miguel</small> Ángel? He died on dry land and never made it to the river, compadre. Se murió en seco. Of course this was bound to happen sometimes. But las doñas had a titanic grip on their dough that was tighter than their clutch on the wooden rosarios hanging from their necks. And to think Miguel Ángel thought he was free! Hell no. These brujas were on top of their load-bearers like no amplified Big Brother we could have ever imagined. 

But the soulless bitches in this distrito slipped. Once. With Miguel Ángel. And I was there, camera-ready and everything. 

## Come to your river

<small>I met Doña Rosa twice</small> after breaking the story about her son. What you know now is, partly, because she told me. Our first convo: her semblance, unchanged, was still lamenting in a profound way. You wouldn’t expect this sort of regal and threatening look from someone like her, a marginal number living in a forgotten pueblo in rural Guatemala. But she was calm, collected and strong, and had been in business for longer than you have been alive. When I asked how she got into this, she shrugged off the question as if I should’ve known better. Perhaps I should’ve, but I was running out of ideas. The circular flow of dough, man. Keeps the world spinning. That was all I got. But this lack of answers would haunt me until the day I knew. 

The next time I saw her, we had a brief encounter. Our last one. She knew she wouldn’t last long. And she didn’t. As she was leaving, retreating back into her cell after our time was up, she fumbled some words in a low tone of voice, a sort of heavy whisper. El Nahualate, el Suchiate, en fin, all the rivers that go into the Pacific… están llenos ya no de peces, sino pescados. Vaya y pesque, cómo lo hizo Pablo. Usted puede cambiar la Historia, cómo Jesús. That was all I got for the story I had planned would catapult my dying career as a journalist. 

By agreeing to speak with me, she became a colaboradora eficaz, and so she became someone’s main target. The priest at the prison chapel, dándole el ultimo adiós a su presencia terrenal, would manifest his frustration towards the inefficacy of the authorities in finding the authors of such terrible criminal masterpieces. Of course, we'll never know what happened to her. Cause of death: unknown. Like the nameless souls of the Guerra Civil whose bones are now mixed with the not-so-fertile soil of this country...

## That's that

<small>I never became a journalist</small>. My story never got published. Heartbroken, I turned to more pragmatical trades and ended up working for some consultancy company in the city. I resorted to living the boring life, the soothing life that dulls your inner light until it can shine no more.

I was bound to continue on this parsimonious track until things changed. The news I had broken years and years ago finally gained relevance. Turns out the river widows had been employed —enslaved?— by the government. The Big Government up north, that is. Mayhem ensued in the world of foreign affairs, and all the nations involved were now being forced to adjust to a new reality, retroactively making ammends, making false promises towards a broken future...  

To think about what we don’t know, the unpublished stories, the disappeared journalists, what floats through the river, the things nobody could have imagined. Until today, the day I finally became a journalist of sorts. 

Como decía mi abuela, nadie sabe para quién trabaja.

## Colophon

<small>A fragment of this story</small> was initially published in TRIBUS ACTUALES, a magazine by <a href="https://imaginatoriostudio.com/" target="blank">Imaginatorio Cooperative</a>, in Guatemala City. It was part of issue #2, which you can find in full <a href="https://issuu.com/tribusactuales/docs/tribus_2_digital_v2" target="_blank">here</a>. 

This whole story was written in two days and edited in the span of a month: a product of an exciting rush and followed by a more cerebral "post-production" period. All in all, it was a great surprise and it unlocked a new source of potential energy, ready to be tapped.
